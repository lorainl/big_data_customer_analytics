# big_data_customer_analytics
<h3>This is the final group project for MGT556 Big Data and Customer Analytics </h3>
The source data is taken from Kaggle: <a href = https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gauravduttakiit/reservation-cancellation-prediction>Link to Dataset</a> <br>
<h3>Objective</h3>
The objective of this project is to build a model to predict customer booking/cancellation status given their reservation details. <br>
<h3>Dataset</h3>
The information available includes: <br>
<ul>

</ul>
<h3> Milestones</h3>
<ul>
  <li>identify the important factors contributing to booking/cancellation status </li>
  <li>establish models to predict the booking/ cancellation outcomes </li>
  <li>compare the models to decide a best one for the project</li>
  <li>implications to bookings in general</li>
